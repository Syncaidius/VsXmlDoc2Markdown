# Visual Studio XML Doc to Markdown

A simple tool for generating markdown files from Visual studio's XML documentation files. Born from an amalgam of curiosity and self-development.

Very work-in-progress. It works, but it doesn't at the same time. Magic eh? ;)


# How to use

Currently, there are two ways to run the tool:

 1. If you're on Windows:
    1. Copy ```run.windows.bat``` to the same directory as VsXmlDoc2Markdown.dll
    2. Drag and drop one or more XML doc files onto ```run.windows.bat``` file
 2. If you're on Windows, Mac or Linux: Run ```dotnet VsXmlDoc2Markdown [XML_filename(s)]``` via command line


Ensure you have the [.NET Core 2.0](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/all) runtime installed before attemping to run.
